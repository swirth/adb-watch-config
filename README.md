# adb-watch-config


## Requirements
ADB (Android Debug Bridge) must be present on the host system. The target system (smartwatch) must have activated developer mode and allow debugging via WLAN. When connecting the hoast to the target for the first time, a question appears on the target as to whether debugging should be allowed. This must be confirmed with "Yes, always from this device".
