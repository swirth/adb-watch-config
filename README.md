# adb-watch-config


## Requirements
ADB (Android Debug Bridge) must be present on the host system. The target system (smartwatch) must have activated developer mode and allow debugging via WLAN. During the first connection from the host to the target, a question appears on the target as to whether debugging should be permitted. This must be confirmed with "Yes" or even better "Yes, always from this device".
